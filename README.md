# triviagame

In this assignment I created a simple, Houston-themed Trivia game using JavaScript and jQuery. 

When the user presses "Start Game," the trivia questions are shown with a 30 second timer. Once the user presses "Submit" or runs out of time, the user can view the number of correct/incorrect/unanswered guesses.
